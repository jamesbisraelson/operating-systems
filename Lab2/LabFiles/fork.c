/*
	fork.c
  COMP 3413 Operating Systems
	
	Simple example of some code that creates processes
	using the fork() system call.
	
	A number of other system calls are also made. They are:
	
	getuid() which returns the numeric userid of the user executing
	the process.
	
	getpid() which returns the numeric process id (PID) of the process.
	
	sleep() which causes the process to sleep for a designated
	number of seconds.
	
	exit() which terminates the program with the specified completion status 
	(zero is normal completion).
	
	For those unfamiliar with C, the %d format code used in the print()
	call causes an integer variable to be formatted for output as a
	decimal ('d') number.
	
	The purpose of the variable j is to illustrate that the child process
	is a duplicate of the parent process, including any variable allocation.
	
	To compile: gcc fork.c

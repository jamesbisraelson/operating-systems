/*
	myexec.c
	COMP 3413 Operating Systems
	
	Simple example of some code that causes a running process to execute a
	different program (entered from standard input). Handling of an error
	situation is also illustrated.
	
	The fgets() function is a 'safe' version of gets() for obtaining user
	input. The gets function does no checking for buffer overflow.
	
	One quirk about using fgets is that it leaves the newline in the input 
	buffer, which will cause exec to fail every time, so we must get rid
	of the newline before passing it to exec.
	
	To compile: gcc myexec.c

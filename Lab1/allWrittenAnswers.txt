Q1:

The "make" command calls "gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I. -Wall" on the command line.
This creates the executable file, "hellomake".
The program can then be run by calling "./hellomake".


Q2a:

The output is:
gcc -Wall -I.   -c -o hellomake.o hellomake.c
gcc -Wall -I.   -c -o hellofunc.o hellofunc.c
gcc -o hellomake hellomake.o hellofunc.o -Wall -I.


Q2b:

The executable file "hellomake" is created, along with the .o files for the project.


Q3:

The output is "make: `hellomake' is up to date."
